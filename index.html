			<h2>Wedding Bells in the House of the Lord</h2>
			<p> By Marilyn Xing </p>
			<p>
				It has been recently announced that Lord Orsino of Illyria has proposed marriage to another after a lengthy and rather blatant pursual of his former 
				love interest the Countess Olivia. Viola of Messaline found herself on Illyrian soil after a ship bound for Messaline sank in the hurricane two days 
				prior. Believing her twin brother Sebastian to have perished in the storm, she entered Orsino’s service under the guise of a man named ‘Cesario’.  
			</p>
			<p>
				Viola as Cesario was sent to present Orsino’s affections to Olivia, and did so with such eloquence that she accidentally earned herself a place in 
				the Countess’s heart. To make matters worse, Viola soon began to nurse her own sentiments for Orsino, and neither he nor Olivia knew of Viola’s true 
				identity. Olivia confronted and confessed to Sebastian who she mistook for Viola as Cesario. Undeterred by the mishap, the two married last week. 
				Viola’s true person was revealed eventually, and the pair are now engaged to be married. The wedding will be taking place tomorrow morning at the 
				Church of St. Jude on Main Street.
			</p>
			<p>
				There has been widespread disapproval with regards to the wedding, most of the backlash targeted at the bride-to-be. 
				The main issue is the fact that she is of Messaline decent, which could be problematic considering the hostility between the two lands.
				Viola has been a member of Orsino’s court for a fairly short period of time, and the public questions her suitability both as a match for Orsino and 
				for Illyria. Sources confirm that Viola and Sebastian were born to a respectable aristocratic family in their homeland, which discredits the notion 
				that they are inexperienced in political affairs. “She was very charming. She was soft with her words and quick on her wits,” says the Countess Olivia.
				In this sense, Viola’s influence would be an asset, assuming she is loyal to Illyria.
			</p>
			<p>
				 Viola’s abilities of deception is of great concern to the public. “Viola hasn’t been in court long and she deceived her way into it.
				 Would it be wise to have such a trickster manipulating Orsino’s strings?” asks Malvolio, a servant in Orsino’s household. 
				 Viola deluded the court into believing she was a man, which is no small feat. This leads many to wonder if she has Illyria’s best interests at heart.
				 “For all we know this is a Messaline plot to infiltrate the court,” he says.  Sebastian himself is married to Countess Olivia; 
				 the land’s four most influential figures are well acquainted. The twins would pose a threat to Illyria if they choose to engage in espionage.
				 “She’s very cunning, and it’s rather tricky to ascertain her true motivations.” claims Valentine, another servant to Orsino. He declined  to comment 
				 on the likelihood of Viola’s treachery. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Despite the overall negative reaction to the wedding, there are still those who protest the good of it. 
				The marriage of a high born Illyrian and Messalian would help ease the tension between our lands. It would be a step towards a compromise and 
				to stabler times. They advocate that Viola’s presence among the court could prove beneficial if she uses her Messalian ties for the good of Illyria.
				Viola and Sebastian could be the key to ending this war and creating a healthy trade relationship with Messaline in the future.

			<h2>Messaline Ship Sinks in Storm - Most Lives Lost</h2>
			<p> By Frank Lai </p>
			<img src="images/weather.jpg" alt = "This image is not availible" style="width : 100%;" />
			<p>
				On January 30th, a ship from Messaline sank near the coast of Illyria in the midst of a terrible storm. The ship carried on board many wealthy 
				passengers on board, including three counts, their families, and a staff of around ten. All are missing, presumably drowned, except the Captain and a
				few sailors. The Captain, now living at the local Inn, did not respond when we asked for comment.
			</p>
			<p>
				This tragedy, however, is not entirely attributable to Poseidon's wrath. Currently, the local authorities are investigating this incident.
				It’s presumed that the cause was due to the ship’s improperly fixed masts. An investigation launched by the local head watchman revealed that 
				the masts were secured with birch and poplar instead of the preferred cedar and oak to save on costs. The railings were also sub-par. “Nearly 
				everything was wrong, save the masts, and those were salvaged from one of his last ships!” exclaimed one of the inspectors, who had previously worked 
				for the ship’s owner.
			</p>
			<p>
				The local head watchman is preparing a case against the ship‘s owner. Currently, jurisdiction falls under that of Countess Olivia, 
				as local affairs are dealt with by their owners. However, the ship’s owner is a distant relative of our local Lord. He may escape any major 
				consequences if Lord Orsino decides to intervene. As well, since the ship was from Messaline, any charges pressed by the Messalians may not hold 
				due to the fact that we are currently at war. In fact, it’s highly likely that Duke Orsino may even invite him over to Illyria if he wishes to seek 
				asylum. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Many people are against that decision, though. Sir Toby Belch and Sir Andrew wishes to see the owner hanged. Many servants of the court also agree.
				Valentine believes that the owner should be tortured, while Curio thinks a steep fine may be punishment enough. Cesario, a recent arrival, believes 
				that we should first take all of his money, and then torture him. It is unlikely that Lord Orsino may go against public opinion.
				Sir Jared v. Sir Andrew played out with Orsino giving in to public opinion.
			</p>
			<p>
				A few sailors from the ship, however, have a contrary opinion. “We love the ship’s owner” they said. “ ‘e always gives good pay raises, 
				and doesn’t make us suffer like the cap’ain does.” The sailor asked us not to use his name as the captain may not like what he says. “ ‘e did nothing wrong!”
				exclaimed one of them.
			</p>
			<p>
				In the end, it’s likely that Justice will be served against the owner, but that does not bring back the many brave and poor souls 
				who perished on the night of January 30th. Many of the most powerful people from Messaline were on that ship, and although they were our enemies, 
				we join them in grievance at the loss of their leaders. I think we would all agree : perhaps it isn’t worth a few pence the lives of men.

			<h2>Sebastian and Cesario - The Ultimate Duo Exposed</h2>
			<p> By Daniel Zeng</p>
			<img src="images/sports.jpg" alt = "This image is not availible" style="width:100%;float:left;" width ="100%" height = "100%"/>
			<p>
				Anyone who has heard about the IEO Fencing Championships will have heard the names Sebastian and Cesario, 
				both of which are reigning champions of the duo men competition winning 3 years in a row.
			</p>
			<p>
				About a week ago, during the closing ceremonies of the IEO, it was revealed that Cesario, was a woman competing in the double men epee event. 
				This was followed by the permanent banning of both Cesario and Sebastian from the tournament and the revocation of their previous achievements 
				from the IEO and the purge of all records of their success as a duo in this event.
			</p>
			<p>
				In all the chaos, the crowd, in shock, began to protest and hiss furiously at the two athletes. This quickly escalated to a riot and security tried 
				to contain the issue but to no avail. Several acts of arson and vandalism were spotted throughout the riot brutally defacing the stadium resulting in 
				an estimated 5.6 million pounds worth of damage. According to the local security office, many security members and spectators were injured during the 
				riot, totaling around 50 injured and 5 severely injured including one man who lost his leg when one section of the stadium collapsed due to the 
				burning of it’s support beams.
			</p>
			<p>
				During the aftermath of the ceremonies and riot, emergency services arrived and the situation was finally brought under control.
			</p>
			<p>
				Charley Fideman, president of the IEO championships stated “We will try our best to fix the situation and all events will be postponed until further notice.”
			</p>
			<p>
				The Rookie All-Star award and 3 championship titles were withdrew from Sebastian and Cesario and were both charged a fine of 125 thousand pounds 
				for breaking Penal Code 406.7 which defines the crime of “incitement to riot” and for breaking the IEO Athlete's code of Honesty and Sportsmanship 
				which states that all participating athletes must meet the requirements of the event.
			</p>
			<p>
				Many fans watching the crisis break out were very disappointed and heartbroken.
			</p>
			<p>
				Emily Carson said “I would have never guessed that someone like Cesario, someone I met outside of competition, who acted like someone honest would do 
				such a thing!”
			</p>
			<p>
				Having seen what could happen if athletes don’t abide by the law and terms, we can only hope that such an event will not occur once again.
